  # Any items in the `env` entry below will be added as
  # environment variables. Some entries may override variables
  # set by alacritty itself.
  env:
    TERM: xterm-256color

  #
  # This value is used to set the `$TERM` environment variable for
  # each instance of Alacritty. If it is not present, alacritty will
  # check the local terminfo database and use `alacritty` if it is
  # available, otherwise `xterm-256color` is used.
  #TERM: xterm-256color

  # Hints
  #
  # Terminal hints can be used to find text or hyperlink in the visible part of
  # the terminal and pipe it to other applications.
  #hints:
  # Keys used for the hint labels.
  alphabet: "jfkdls;ahgurieowpq"

  # List with all available hints
  #
  # Each hint must have any of `regex` or `hyperlinks` field and either an
  # `action` or a `command` field. The fields `mouse`, `binding` and
  # `post_processing` are optional.
  #
  # The `hyperlinks` option will cause OSC 8 escape sequence hyperlinks to be
  # highlighted.
  #
  # The fields `command`, `binding.key`, `binding.mods`, `binding.mode` and
  # `mouse.mods` accept the same values as they do in the `key_bindings` section.
  #
  # The `mouse.enabled` field controls if the hint should be underlined while
  # the mouse with all `mouse.mods` keys held or the vi mode cursor is above it.
  #
  # If the `post_processing` field is set to `true`, heuristics will be used to
  # shorten the match if there are characters likely not to be part of the hint
  # (e.g. a trailing `.`). This is most useful for URIs and applies only to
  # `regex` matches.
  #
  # Values for `action`:
  #   - Copy
  #       Copy the hint's text to the clipboard.
  #   - Paste
  #       Paste the hint's text to the terminal or search.
  #   - Select
  #       Select the hint's text.
  #   - MoveViModeCursor
  #       Move the vi mode cursor to the beginning of the hint.

  # Window padding (changes require restart)

  # Spread additional padding evenly around the terminal content.
  dynamic_padding: false

  # Window decorations
  #
  # Values for `decorations`:
  #     - full: Borders and title bar
  #     - none: Neither borders nor title bar
  #
  # Values for `decorations` (macOS only):
  #     - transparent: Title bar, transparent background and title bar buttons
  #     - buttonless: Title bar, transparent background, but no title bar buttons
  decorations: buttonless

  # When true, alacritty starts maximized.
  # start_maximized: false

scrolling:
  # Maximum number of lines in the scrollback buffer.
  # Specifying '0' will disable scrolling.
  history: 10000

  # Number of lines the viewport will move for every line scrolled when
  # scrollback is enabled (history > 0).
  multiplier: 3

  # Faux Scrolling
  #
  # The `faux_multiplier` setting controls the number of lines the terminal
  # should scroll when the alternate screen buffer is active. This is used
  # to allow mouse scrolling for applications like `man`.
  #
  # Specifying `0` will disable faux scrolling.
  # faux_multiplier: 3

# Font configuration (changes require restart)
font:
  # Normal (roman) font face
  normal:
    # Font family
    #
    # Default:
    #   - (macOS) Menlo
    #   - (Linux) monospace
    #   - (Windows) Consolas
    family: SauceCodePro Nerd Font

    # The `style` can be specified to pick a specific face.
    style: Regular

  # Bold font face
  bold:
    # Font family
    #
    # If the bold family is not specified, it will fall back to the
    # value specified for the normal font.
    family: SauceCodePro Nerd Font

    # The `style` can be specified to pick a specific face.
    style: Bold

  # Italic font face
  italic:
    # Font family
    #
    # If the italic family is not specified, it will fall back to the
    # value specified for the normal font.
    family: SauceCodePro Nerd Font

    # The `style` can be specified to pick a specific face.
    style: Italic

  # Point size
  size: 11.0

  # Offset is the extra space around each character. `offset.y` can be thought of
  # as modifying the line spacing, and `offset.x` as modifying the letter spacing.
  offset:
    x: 0
    y: 0

  # Glyph offset determines the locations of the glyphs within their cells with
  # the default being at the bottom. Increasing `x` moves the glyph to the right,
  # increasing `y` moves the glyph upwards.
  glyph_offset:
    x: 0
    y: 0

  # Thin stroke font rendering (macOS only)
  #
  # Thin strokes are suitable for retina displays, but for non-retina screens
  # it is recommended to set `use_thin_strokes` to `false`
  #
  # macOS >= 10.14.x:
  #
  # If the font quality on non-retina display looks bad then set
  # `use_thin_strokes` to `true` and enable font smoothing by running the
  # following command:
  #   `defaults write -g CGFontRenderingFontSmoothingDisabled -bool NO`
  #
  # This is a global setting and will require a log out or restart to take
  # effect.
  #use_thin_strokes: true

# Display the time it takes to redraw each frame.
# render_timer: false

# Keep the log file after quitting Alacritty.
# persistent_logging: false

# If `true`, bold text is drawn using the bright color variants.

# Visual Bell
#
# Any time the BEL code is received, Alacritty "rings" the visual bell. Once
# rung, the terminal background will be set to white and transition back to the
# default background color. You can control the rate of this transition by
# setting the `duration` property (represented in milliseconds). You can also
# configure the transition function by setting the `animation` property.
#
# Values for `animation`:
#   - Ease
#   - EaseOut
#   - EaseOutSine
#   - EaseOutQuad
#   - EaseOutCubic
#   - EaseOutQuart
#   - EaseOutQuint
#   - EaseOutExpo
#   - EaseOutCirc
#   - Linear
#
# Specifying a `duration` of `0` will disable the visual bell.
bell:
  animation: EaseOutExpo
  duration: 0
  color: "0xffffff"

# Mouse bindings
#
# Available fields:
#   - mouse
#   - action
#   - mods (optional)
#
# Values for `mouse`:
#   - Middle
#   - Left
#   - Right
#   - Numeric identifier such as `5`
#
# All available `mods` and `action` values are documented in the key binding
# section.
mouse_bindings:
  - { mouse: Middle, action: PasteSelection }

mouse:
  # Click settings
  #
  # The `double_click` and `triple_click` settings control the time
  # alacritty should wait for accepting multiple clicks as one double
  # or triple click.
  double_click: { threshold: 300 }
  triple_click: { threshold: 300 }

  # If this is `true`, the cursor is temporarily hidden
