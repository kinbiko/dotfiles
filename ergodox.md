# Ergodox online configurations and comments

This is a list of all my ergodox configs as they are online.
Unfortunately, simply storing the config isn't enough to modify it later on.

Remember:

When selecting `"` in the online utility, because of my keyboard mapping this will actually be `@`
"non-US\" is actually backtick
backtick is actually \
\ is actually #

Maybe it's easier to switch to a US english keyboard layout?

Future ideas and bugs to be squashed:

- Get rid of numbers along the top entirely. I rarely hit the right one, and it's probably easier for me to hit two modes to get it into a mode where the numpad becomes available. Then I won't be as tempted to use the top row for programming buttons like !"\$%^&\*()\_+=- etc.
- Make layer 1 + caps lock do backspace.
- Mouse button clicks
- The lights doesn't appear to work with this one. I think I chose glow, which might not match what my keyboard is capable of.
- caps lock becomes ctrl when held or escape when not held
- big button []{} goes away in favour of second layer
- left 'enter' is layer 2
- Clean up weird stuff in layer 0

## version 2

https://configure.ergodox-ez.com/ergodox-ez/layouts/XbMwy/latest/2

### Bugs and future ideas

- Has no way of doing minus or equals

## Version 3

https://configure.ergodox-ez.com/ergodox-ez/layouts/40E5n/latest/1

- OK so minus and equals came back, but has no way of hitting plus and underscore?
- Need to be able to turn off the colours so it's not distracting to other people

## Version 4

https://configure.ergodox-ez.com/ergodox-ez/layouts/Rjr55/latest/0

- Still has no way of toggling or weakening the colours between layers

## Version 5

https://configure.ergodox-ez.com/ergodox-ez/layouts/JaQLB/latest/2

- need to remap go to defn and pop in vim or make [] easier to hit in combination with space
- touch time for tap vs. press is far too short
- would be good to have quotes on the bottom left row, then brackets above that, the funky symbols above that
- Make layer 1 arros keys be hjkl. Mouse clicks can be the remaining thumb button on the left
- switch & and \*

# Version 6

https://configure.ergodox-ez.com/ergodox-ez/layouts/9DKbW/latest/1

- ctrl + esc thing is still a bit awkward when trying to quickly ctrl+a in tmux for instance. Might be best to only have it as ctrl.
- having @ and ~ right next to each other can lead to awkward executions of a register when I want to change the capitalisation of a character in vim
- It's a bit awkward reaching the most common numbers right now. consider moving numbers to half above the hjkl keys and half below.
- Also, let's make the number rows 01234,56789 as 1 and 0 are used together a lot.
- Need to get ^ back to an easier position to hit.

# Version 7

https://configure.ergodox-ez.com/ergodox-ez/layouts/bv5gg/latest/0

- Add red/green/refactor backlight buttons
- Right now creating code blocks in markdown and escaping in strings or typing postgres commands is really awkward.
  Make \`\`\` and \ easier to reach. Maybe instead of - and = on the big keys on the lhs which I never use.

# Version 8

https://configure.ergodox-ez.com/ergodox-ez/layouts/x9Jqo/latest/0

- make hitting ctrl+tab easier
- left 'enter' key is never used.
- make layer 1 caps lock be esc
- re-map the RHS bottom row arrow keys to something more useful, as I keep using layer 1 + hjkl anyway for arrows
  - mouse movement
- expose F keys

# Version 9
