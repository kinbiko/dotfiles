# Ergodox online configurations and comments

This is a list of all my ergodox configs as they are online.
Unfortunately, simply storing the config isn't enough to modify it later on.

Remember:

When selecting `"` in the online utility, because of my keyboard mapping this will actually be `@`
"non-US\" is actually backtick
backtick is actually \
\ is actually #

Maybe it's easier to switch to a US english keyboard layout?

Future ideas and bugs to be squashed:

+ Get rid of numbers along the top entirely. I rarely hit the right one, and it's probably easier for me to hit two modes to get it into a mode where the numpad becomes available.  Then I won't be as tempted to use the top row for programming buttons like !"$%^&*()_+=- etc.
+ Make layer 1 + caps lock do backspace.
+ Mouse button clicks
+ The lights doesn't appear to work with this one. I think I chose glow, which might not match what my keyboard is capable of.
+ caps lock becomes ctrl when held or escape when not held
+ big button []{} goes away in favour of second layer
+ left 'enter' is layer 2
+ Clean up weird stuff in layer 0



## version 2

### Bugs and future ideas

* Has no way of doing minus or equals

## Version 3

https://configure.ergodox-ez.com/ergodox-ez/layouts/40E5n/latest/1

- OK so minus and equals came back, but has no way of hitting plus and underscore?
- Need to be able to turn off the colours so it's not distracting to other people

## Version 4

https://configure.ergodox-ez.com/ergodox-ez/layouts/Rjr55/latest/0

- Still has no way of toggling or weakening the colours between layers

## Version 5

https://configure.ergodox-ez.com/ergodox-ez/layouts/JaQLB/latest/2

Seems to work well enough.
