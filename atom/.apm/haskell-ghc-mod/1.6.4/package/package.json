It uses temporary files to feed them into ghc-mod (since it does\nnot read from stdin)\n\nIf ghc-mod/ghc-modi is not in your PATH, set full path to those in config.\n\n## Dependencies\n\nNOTE: when using with stack, see https://github.com/atom-haskell/haskell-ghc-mod/wiki/Using-with-stack\n\nYou need to have `ghc-mod`, `ghc-modi` (part of ghc-mod) and `hlint` executables\ninstalled on your system. `ghc-mod` needs to be able to find `hlint` (eiter add `hlint` directory to PATH, or install both in the same cabal sandbox).\n\nSupported `ghc-mod` versions are from 4.1.0 to 5.2.1.2, and 5.4.x. 5.3.x might work, but is not officially supported.\n\nQuick setup is as follows:\n\n```\n$ cabal update\n$ cabal install ghc-mod\n```\n\nAfter this process finishes, you'll have `ghc-mod`, `ghc-modi` and `hlint` available in `$HOME/.cabal/bin/` directory.\n\nPlease note, that for ghc>=7.10 and/or cabal>=1.22, you need ghc-mod>=5.3.0.0. ghc-mod versions before 5.3.0.0 won't work.\n\nUser interface is provided by [ide-haskell](https://atom.io/packages/ide-haskell)\n\n## Installation\n\n```\n$ apm install language-haskell haskell-ghc-mod ide-haskell autocomplete-haskell\n```\n\n## Configuration\n\nNOTE: when using with stack, see https://github.com/atom-haskell/haskell-ghc-mod/wiki/Using-with-stack\n\nOnly configuration options you will likely need to set are `ghcModPath` and,\nfor ghc-mod<5.4.0.0, `ghcModiPath`. Both need to be set to full path to `ghc-mod` and `ghc-modi` programs respectively, if those are not in your PATH.\n\nNote, that ghc-mod>=5.4.0.0 doesn't use `ghcModiPath` setting (instead running\nghc-mod in interactive mode directly).\n\nThere can be some problems with ghc-modi upstream, most notably, it does not\nwork on paths with whitespace. If you experience problems, try disabling\n`ghc-modi` by setting `enableGhcModi` to `false` (or uncheck tick in settings).\nThis will be slower, but may work better on some configurations.\n\nIf you are on OSX, or have ghc installed with non-standard prefix, you may also\nconsider adding path to directory containing ghc/ghci executable to\n`additionalPathDirectories` configuration option. It is a comma-separated list\nof directories that will be added to your search path when invoking ghc-mod.\nFor example, if you have ghc installed to `/usr/local`, then you would add\n`/usr/local/bin` to `additionalPathDirectories`.\n\nOn OSX, if you start Atom from Finder or with desktop icon, it doesn't inherit\nenvironment variables specified in your user shell (in `.profile`, `.bashrc`,\netc). You can copy `PATH` settings from your shell to\n`additionalPathDirectories`, if you'd like to run Atom in this way.\n\n## Keybindings\n\nHaskell-ghc-mod comes with little pre-specified keybindings, so you will need to specify your own, if you want those.\n\nYou can edit Atom keybindings by opening 'Edit → Open Your Keymap'. Here is a template for all commands, provided by haskell-ghc-mod:\n\n```cson\n'atom-text-editor[data-grammar~=\"haskell\"]':\n  '': 'haskell-ghc-mod:check-file'\n  '': 'haskell-ghc-mod:lint-file'\n  'ctrl-alt-t': 'haskell-ghc-mod:show-type' #this is an example binding\n  'ctrl-alt-i': 'haskell-ghc-mod:show-info' #this is an example binding\n  'ctrl-alt-T': 'haskell-ghc-mod:insert-type' #this is an example binding\n  '': 'haskell-ghc-mod:show-info-fallback-to-type'\n  '': 'haskell-ghc-mod:insert-import'\n\n'atom-workspace':\n  '': 'haskell-ghc-mod:shutdown-backend'\n```\n\n## Service-hub API\n\nSince 1.0.0, haskell-ghc-mod provides `haskell-completion-backend` service.\n\n**NOTE**: Prior to 1.0.0, ide-backend service was provided. It has been scrapped in favor of ide-haskell's UPI.\n\nYou can find description in [completion-backend.coffee][2]\n\n[2]:https://github.com/atom-haskell/haskell-ghc-mod/blob/master/lib/completion-backend/completion-backend.coffee\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/atom-haskell/haskell-ghc-mod/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/atom-haskell/haskell-ghc-mod#readme","_id":"haskell-ghc-mod@1.6.4","_shasum":"ae45b3f09ca24a877f8d6d9efe667fb41fd51e4e","_resolved":"file:../d-116028-39118-wdz4j1/package.tgz","_from":"../d-116028-39118-wdz4j1/package.tgz"}
